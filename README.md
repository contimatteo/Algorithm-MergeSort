# Merge Sort Algorithm
Development of the MergeSort algorithm and represented by its graphical execution.

### The Algorithm
The Merge Sort is a sorting algorithm based on comparisons that uses a recursive resolution process, exploiting the technique of Divide and Impera, which consists in subdividing the problem into sub-problems of the same dimension of dimension gradually becoming smaller. 
It was invented by John von Neumann in 1945.

## Getting Started
Internet connection needed ‚úåüèº

###  Prerequisites
Install Java JDK on your local machine

## Installing

###  Before we start
1. First extract the content of the `/build` directory
2. Create a *.txt* file like this and copy it into the same folder used at pervious step
```

78
2
```
NB: in this way this numbers can be used afterwards as input for the Algorithm

## Deployment
Simply run the `MC_MergeSort.jar` file and following the instructions shown üçª

(By inserting the name of the *.txt* file previously created you can use it as input for the algorithm.)
