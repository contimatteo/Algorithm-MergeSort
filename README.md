## *Merge-Sort*
In computer science, merge sort (also commonly spelled Merge-Sort) is an efficient, general-purpose, comparison-based sorting algorithm. Most implementations produce a stable sort, which means that the implementation preserves the input order of equal elements in the sorted output. Merge-Sort is a divide and conquer algorithm that was invented by John von Neumann in 1945.[1] A detailed description and analysis of bottom-up Merge-Sort appeared in a report by Goldstine and Neumann as early as 1948.
